# C Challenges

Welcome to the **C Challenges** repository! This collection contains a wide range of C programming exercises, organized by chapters and difficulty. It's designed for learners and enthusiasts who want to practice and improve their C programming skills.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into chapter-based folders, each containing multiple C source files:

```
C Challenges/
  ch-2/    # Beginner challenges (files 1.c to 10.c)
  ch-3/    # More beginner/intermediate challenges
  ch-4/
  ch-5/
  ch-6/
  ch-7/
  ch-8/
  ch-9/
  ch-10/
  ch-11/
  ch-12/
  ch-13/   # May include extra data files for file I/O challenges
```

Each `.c` file is a standalone program, typically named by its challenge number (e.g., `1.c`, `42.c`, etc.).

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Browse the Chapters:**  
   Navigate to any chapter folder to find the C source files.

2. **Compile a Challenge:**  
   Use a C compiler like `gcc` to compile any challenge. For example:
   ```sh
   gcc ch-2/1.c -o ch-2/1
   ./ch-2/1
   ```

3. **File I/O Challenges:**  
   Some challenges (especially in `ch-13/`) may require input files (e.g., `data.txt`, `file_input.txt`). Make sure these files are present in the same directory as the `.c` file when running the program.

## 🏆 Who Is This For?

- **Students** learning C programming
- **Interview preparation**
- **Anyone** looking to practice and improve their C skills
